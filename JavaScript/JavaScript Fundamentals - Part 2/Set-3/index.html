    <p>Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use objects to
      implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass
      / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter)
      Your tasks:</p>
      <p>1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and
      height (Mark Miller and John Smith)</p>

    <p>  2. Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same
      method on both objects). Store the BMI value to a property, and also return it
      from the method</p>

    <p>  3. Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the
      respective BMI. Example: "John's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark's (23.9)!"</p>
      
    <p>  Test data: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m
      tall.</p>
