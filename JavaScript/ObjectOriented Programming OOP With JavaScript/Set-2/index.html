    <p>Your tasks:<br>
      1. Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')<br>
      2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide
      by 1.6)<br>
      3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but
      converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)<br>
      4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake'
      methods, and with the getter and setter.<br>
      Test data:<br>
      Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h</p>
