    <p>Your tasks:<br>
      1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called 'EV') as a child
      "class" of 'Car'. Besides a make and current speed, the 'EV' also has the
      current battery charge in % ('charge' property)<br>
      2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument
      'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo'<br>
      3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20,
      and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140
      km/h, with a charge of 22%'<br>
      4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate',
      'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when
      you 'accelerate'! Hint: Review the definiton of polymorphism <br>
      Test data:<br>
      Data car 1: 'Tesla' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%</p>
