    <p>Your tasks:<br>
      1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'. A car has a 'make' and a
      'speed' property. The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in
      km/h<br>
      2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10,
      and log the new speed to the console<br>
      3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log
      the new speed to the console<br>
      4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and
      'brake' multiple times on each of them<br>
      Test data:<br>
      Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h<br>
      Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h</p>
