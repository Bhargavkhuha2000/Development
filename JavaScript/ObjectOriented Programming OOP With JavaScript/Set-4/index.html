    <p>Your tasks:<br>
      1. Re-create Challenge #3, but this time using ES6 classes: create an 'EVCl'
      child class of the 'CarCl' class<br>
      2. Make the 'charge' property private<br>
      3. Implement the ability to chain the 'accelerate' and 'chargeBattery'
      methods of this class, and also update the 'brake' method in the 'CarCl'
      class. Then experiment with chaining!<br>
      Test data:<br>
      Data car 1: 'Rivian' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%</p>
