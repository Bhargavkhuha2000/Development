    <p>Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
      calculated using the formula:</p>

      <p>BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
      and height in meter).</p>
      
      <p>Your tasks:</p>
      
      <p>1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables</p>
      
      <p>2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
      versions)</p>
      
      <p>3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
      whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.</p>
      
      <p>Test data:</p>
      
      <P> Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
      m tall.</P>
      
      <p>Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
      m tall.</p>
