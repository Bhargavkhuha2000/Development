    <p>Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert
      dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.<br>
      Your tasks:<br>
      Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's
      ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:<br>
      1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is
      <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old,
      humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4<br>
      2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as
      keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)<br>
      3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know
      from other challenges how we calculate averages )<br>
      4. Run the function for both test datasets<br>
      Test data:<br>
      Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]<br>
      Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]</p>
